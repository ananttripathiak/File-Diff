# DiffLens

A fast, fully **client-side** code and text diff tool. Paste snippets or upload files, pick a view, and compare — nothing leaves your browser.

**Live app → [ananttripathiak.github.io/File-Diff](https://ananttripathiak.github.io/File-Diff/)**

## Features

- **Three diff views**
  - **Side by Side** — classic two-column diff
  - **Unified** — single-column unified patch view
  - **Char Diff** — shows every line; changed characters highlighted inline
- **Paste or upload** — each pane has a paste tab and a drag-and-drop upload tab, independently
- **Jupyter notebook support** — `.ipynb` files are parsed into readable cell blocks before diffing
- **Swap sides** — one click to flip left ↔ right
- **Live stats badge** — shows `+N / -N` lines changed after each compare
- **Dark / light mode** — toggle in the header, zero flash
- **Zero backend** — runs entirely in the browser; no data is sent anywhere
